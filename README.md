# Build your own React (with TypeScript)

This project is an implementation of a simple version of rendering React from scratch, using TypeScript.

## Installation

**Download** or **clone** the repository to run locally:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/itsjoelle/react-from-scratch.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed and then install the required dependencies:

```zsh
npm install
```

### Compile TypeScript code in watch mode

```zsh
npm run dev
```

### Run the Server

To start the static server and test the renderer in the browser:

```zsh
npx serve .
```

The server will listen on PORT 3000 by default.

## Features

- Create virtual DOM elements with a custom implementation of `React.createElement`

- Render virtual DOM to the actual browser DOM with a custom `render()` function.

- A simple component-based structure using function components.

## How It Works

The `React.createElement` function is responsible for creating virtual DOM nodes. It can handle both plain HTML elements and functional components.

The `render()` function takes these virtual nodes and transforms them into real DOM elements, handling component functions, text nodes, props, and children recursively.

This replicates the core logic of Reactâ€™s rendering pipeline, without the overhead of a full library.

## Folder Structure

- **app.tsx**: Entry point where the virtual components are defined and rendered into the DOM.

- **app.js**: Includes compiled JavaScript code.

- **tsconfigconfig.js**: TypeScript configuration file for compiling and telling TypeScript how to handle JSX syntax.

- **index.html**: Basic HTML structure including the root container.

## Contributing
